# Submission Guidelines & Terms

These guidelines set out the expectations, standards, and rules for student project submissions. Please read them carefully and ensure your project complies with all sections before submission.

## 1. Required submission items

### 1.1 README.md (Project Documentation)

Your `README.md` is the main documentation for your project. It must be clear enough for someone unfamiliar with your work to understand and run it.

Your README must include:

#### i. Overview

A short description (2–5 sentences) explaining:

- What your project does.
- What problem it solves.
- Who the intended users are.

#### ii. Features

- A bullet list of features that are implemented and working.
- Do not list planned or future features as if they already exist.

#### iii. Install and run instructions

- Step-by-step instructions to install dependencies and run the project.
- Assume the reader has basic technical skills but no prior knowledge of your code.

#### iv. Tech stack

List the main technologies used, e.g.:

- Programming languages.
- Frameworks.
- Databases.
- Cloud services.
- AI/ML libraries or models.

#### v. Usage examples

- Show how to use the project once it is running.
- You may include:
  - Command examples
  - Example API calls
  - Sample inputs/outputs
  - Screenshots (if applicable)

#### vi. Optional but recommended sections

- Architecture notes: short explanation of how the system is structured (e.g., frontend, backend, database, external APIs).
- Limitations: honest description of what does not work or is not fully implemented.
- Future improvements: features or changes you would make with more time.

## 2. Codebase requirements

Your repository must contain everything needed to understand and run your project.

### 2.1 Complete source code

- Include all source files used by your project (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, etc.).
- Ensure no imported modules or files are missing.
- Test by cloning your repository to a new location and following your own setup instructions.

### 2.2 Dependency files

Provide the necessary configuration for installing dependencies, for example:

- Python: `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Node.js: `package.json` (and optionally `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`/`yarn.lock`)
- Conda: `environment.yml`

These files must allow judges to install dependencies with standard commands such as:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `npm install`
- `conda env create -f environment.yml`

### 2.3 Configuration files

Include configuration examples without exposing secrets.

- `.env.example` should list all required environment variables.
- Do not include real passwords, API keys, or confidential data.

You may also include:

- Configuration folders (e.g., `config/`).
- Settings files (e.g., `settings.py`, `config.json`).

### 2.4 Folder structure

Avoid single-file projects. Use a clear and logical structure, for example:

```text
project/
├─ src/
├─ tests/
├─ assets/
├─ README.md
└─ requirements.txt
```

Additional common directories:

- `docs/` for extra documentation.
- `scripts/` for helper or utility scripts.

A clean structure is required to help judges navigate your project quickly.

## 3. Tests (optional but encouraged)

Tests are optional but required if you want to be assessed on test coverage.

Place tests in a `tests/` directory, or:

- Use filenames like `test_*.py` (Python).
- Use `*.test.js` / `*.spec.js` (JavaScript/TypeScript).

Tests must be real and meaningful, not empty placeholders.

## 4. Feature accuracy and honesty

Your documentation must reflect the actual state of your project.

- Every feature listed in the README must exist and be usable in the codebase.
- Partially implemented or incomplete features must be clearly labelled as such.

Examples of accurate descriptions:

- “User registration is implemented with a basic form; email verification is not yet supported.”
- “The dashboard page is present, but charts are static and not connected to live data.”

Misrepresenting features or claiming work that has not been done may lead to disqualification.

## 5. Code quality standards

You are expected to follow basic open-source style and good engineering practices.

### 5.1 Structure and organisation

- Use a logical folder structure (see Section 2.4).
- Avoid placing all logic in a single file (e.g., `main.py`, `index.js`).

### 5.2 Naming and comments

- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and files (e.g., `calculate_score`, `user_session`, `task_repository`).
- Avoid meaningless names (e.g., `temp1`, `x2`, `data1`).

Include helpful comments and docstrings:

- Explain why something is done or any non-obvious logic.
- Add docstrings for important functions, classes, and modules.

### 5.3 Security and secrets

- Do not hard code:
  - Usernames
  - Passwords
  - API keys
  - Tokens
- Use environment variables and reference them in code.
- Provide `env.example` instead of your real `.env` file.

### 5.4 Clean-up before submission

Before submitting:

- Remove unused files, temporary scripts, and test data that are not needed.
- Remove debugging code (e.g., stray print statements, console logs).
- Remove local log files and output artefacts (e.g., `debug.log`, `output.txt`).

Readable, straightforward code is preferred over unnecessarily complex or “clever” solutions.

## 6. Highlighting technical depth (if applicable)

If your project uses advanced technologies (e.g., AI, data pipelines, etc), you should:

- Provide a short explanation in the README:
  - What technologies or techniques you used.
  - Why you chose them.
  - What problem they solve in your project.
- Optionally include simple diagrams (inline in the README or in a `docs/` folder), such as:
  - System architecture diagrams (e.g., client → backend → database → external API).
  - Data flow diagrams (e.g., input → processing → output).

Example explanation:

> We use a fine-tuned transformer model to classify user support tickets by topic. This improves routing accuracy compared to keyword-based matching, which performed poorly in our tests.

This helps reviewers understand the complexity and innovation in your submission.

## 7. Open-source compliance and DCO terms

These terms are mandatory for participation. By submitting a project, you confirm that you comply with the following.

### 7.1 GitHub accounts and commit sign-off

You may use:

- Your personal GitHub account.

All commits must be compatible with:

- Apache License 2.0.
- Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

You are responsible for following the hackathon instructions on commit sign-off (for example, using `git commit -s` and including the correct sign-off text).

### 7.2 Single email rule

You must use a single email address for:

- All Git commits.
- All hackathon-related communication.
- The entire duration of the event.

This ensures consistent identification of your contributions.

### 7.3 Identity and representation

- Do not use fake identities, pseudonymous company personas, or shared corporate GitHub users.
- All contributions are made in a personal capacity and not as official company work, unless explicitly authorised and disclosed.

### 7.4 Licensing, policies, and conflicts of interest

You must:

- Comply with the open-source policies.
- Follow external open-source standards, including the DCO requirements.
- Not disclose or use confidential or proprietary company information in your project.
- Use personal devices for hackathon work unless company policy explicitly allows otherwise.

### 7.5 Repository visibility

- During the hackathon, your GitHub repository must remain private.
- After submission and review, repositories may be made public, as required by the event rules.

### 7.6 No plagiarism policy

- All project work must be original to you and your team.
- You must not copy other teams’ work or reuse previous projects as if they were new submissions.
- Using open-source libraries and frameworks is allowed, but your project must add original code, configuration, and integration work.
- You must respect licences of all third-party dependencies.

Violation of these terms may result in disqualification.

## 8. Recommended learning resources (optional)

The following external courses are recommended to improve your understanding of open source, but they are not mandatory.

## 9. Final requirements and expectations

By submitting your project, you confirm that:

- It is reasonably easy to install and run using the instructions you provide.
- Your README clearly describes what the project does and how to use it.
- The folder structure and code organisation are clear and navigable.
- The features you claim are implemented and functional.
- You have followed the code quality, security, and compliance guidelines above.

Clear documentation, clean code, and honest representation of your work are essential requirements for a valid and strong submission.
