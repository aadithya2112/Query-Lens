# Talk to Data – Seamless Self-Service Intelligence

Build solutions using free-tier AI of your choice that can work with datasets and make the process self-service to aid re-use.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to get quick, accurate, and trustworthy answers from data. They face challenges such as:

- Too many steps or complicated tools.
- Unclear terminology.
- Pressure to respond fast.
- Lack of confidence in the data.

Your task is to remove friction and help everyday users “talk” to data effortlessly, receiving answers they can trust.

## Description

Create a solution where users can ask natural language questions about any dataset and instantly receive:

- Clear explanations.
- Verified insights.
- Transparent data sources.
- Minimal steps.
- No exposure of private or sensitive data.

Focus on the three pillars:

- **Clarity:** Answers simple enough for nonexperts.
- **Trust:** Clear definitions, consistent metrics, and source transparency.
- **Speed:** Near-instant responses without complex workflows.

## Use Cases

### 1) Understand What Changed

**Users ask:**

- “Why did revenue drop last month?”
- “What caused customer complaints to rise?”

**The AI system should:**

- Identify the drivers behind increases or decreases.
- Highlight the most influential categories (e.g., region, product, channel).
- Provide clear, concise explanations in everyday language.
- Reference data sources used for the insight.

**Output example:**

Revenue decreased by 11% in Feb. The biggest contributor was a 22% drop in the South region due to reduced ad spend.

### 2) Breakdown (Decomposition)

**Users ask:**

- “What makes up total sales?”
- “Show the breakdown of costs by department.”

**The system should:**

- Decompose a number into its components (by region/category/product/channel).
- Surface patterns (e.g., concentration, outliers).
- Highlight the biggest contributors.
- Provide both table and narrative explanation.

**Output example:**

North region accounts for 40% of total sales, with Retail contributing most of that share.

### 3) Compare (Time, Region, Product, Segment)

**Queries may include:**

- “This week vs last week”
- “Region A vs Region B”
- “Product X vs Product Y performance”

**The AI should:**

- Interpret the comparison intent.
- Apply consistent metric definitions.
- Generate an easy-to-understand comparison (visual + text).
- Identify statistically relevant differences.
- Handle ambiguous phrases like “this month” or “last cycle”.

**Output example:**

Product A grew by 8% WoW, outperforming Product B (+2%). Primary reason: higher return customer rate.

### 4) Summarize (Daily/Weekly/Monthly Insights)

**A simple prompt such as:**

- “Give me a weekly summary for customer metrics.”

**The AI should:**

- Scan datasets for trends, anomalies, and important shifts.
- Produce a concise update.
- Avoid noise – focus on what truly matters.
- Provide source references.
- Make summaries easy for leadership and nontechnical users.

**Output example:**

This week: Signups grew by 5%, churn remained stable, and average handle time improved by 12 seconds.

## Participants Will Learn

### 1) How to turn everyday questions into trustworthy answers

- Translating vague or informal queries into structured analytical tasks.
- Handling ambiguous or incomplete questions safely.
- Providing grounded, data-backed responses.

### 2) Why shared definitions matter for consistent results

- Building a semantic layer/metric dictionary.
- Ensuring “revenue”, “orders”, “active users” always mean the same thing.
- Preventing misalignment across teams.

### 3) How to explain results clearly to non-experts

- Removing jargon.
- Using simple language.
- Surface-first summaries with deeper layers available.
- Showing data sources and reasoning transparently.
